# Rapid Mangrove Survey - Point-centered quarter transects (PCQT)

The point-centered quarter transects (PCQT) is a method based on the publication from Cintron & Novelli (1984) to characterize mangrove forest structure, zonation, regeneration potential and relative abundance of species, before setting up permanent plots or experiments. Allometric equations can be used to calculate the above ground biomass based on the diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height (ht).
For this method at least 20 data points have to be included. These data points can be aligned parallel or perpendicular to the coast along a transect line. For mangrove forests with different zonation (fringe, transition, dwarf zone) the perpendicular methods (from coast line to mainland) is suggested.

Four distances are measured from each point to the nearest trees in each of the quarters (see image below).

 The area around the point is divided into four quarters by a line running perpendicular to the bearing line. The points are separated by the distance long enough so that the same trees are not enumerated twice. The dbh and ht is measured for each tree. Dbh is measured right on top of the last anchoring prop root or at 1.3 m above the soil. These values can be used to calculate the above ground biomass: `biomass = (dbh)^2 x ht`

Furthermore, seedlings and propagules will be counted in each of the four quadrats to estimate regeneration potential. Any tree of a dbh <2.5cm is considered a seedling.
Additionally, a water sample is been taken at each data point (n=20) for measurements of salinity. The water is taken with a syringe slightly from below the ground in the mud.
